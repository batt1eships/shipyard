A corbita (plural: corbitae) is a type of ancient Roman merchant ship. It was designed for cargo transport and was quite common in the Mediterranean during the Roman Empire. Here are some key features of a corbitae:

Shape and Design: Corbitae were typically flat-bottomed and had a wide, rounded hull. This design made them particularly well-suited for carrying heavy loads and for operating in shallow waters.
Sails and Oars: They were usually equipped with a single mast and a square sail, which allowed them to make good use of the prevailing winds. Additionally, they often had oars to assist with navigation, especially when wind conditions were not favorable.
Size and Capacity: Corbitae varied in size, but they were generally smaller than the large cargo ships (like the navis oneraria) and were often used for local or regional trade rather than long-distance voyages.
Usage: These ships were primarily used for transporting goods such as grain, wine, and olive oil. Their design made them versatile for the bustling trade routes of the Roman Empire.
Overall, the corbitae played a crucial role in the Roman economy by facilitating trade across the Mediterranean Sea.
